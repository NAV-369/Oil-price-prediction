# Task-1: Data Analysis Workflow and Model Understanding

## Overview

Task-1 involves defining the data analysis workflow and understanding the model and data used in this project. The goal of this task is to ensure a clear understanding of the steps involved in analyzing the data, the models used, and how the insights generated align with the business objectives.

## Objectives

### 1. Defining the Data Analysis Workflow
- Clearly outline the steps and processes involved in analyzing Brent oil prices data.
- Understand how the data is generated, sampled, and compiled.
- Identify the model inputs, parameters, and outputs.
- Identify and state any assumptions and limitations of the analysis.
- Determine the main media channels and formats for communicating results to stakeholders.

### 2. Understanding the Model and Data
- Read key references to grasp the core concepts and models.
- Familiarize with models suitable for time series analysis, such as ARIMA and GARCH, and how they relate to Brent oil prices data.
- Explain the purpose and application of these models for forecasting price fluctuations.
- Describe the processes that generate the data and how these are modeled.
- Discuss the expected outputs, limitations, and how predictions are made.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Load and clean the Brent oil price data to prepare it for analysis.
   - Handle missing data, convert date formats, and create necessary features for model training.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize and explore trends, seasonality, and correlations in the Brent oil prices.
   - Use graphs and summary statistics to identify key patterns.

3. **Model Building**  
   - Apply ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for time series forecasting of Brent oil prices.
   - Optionally, apply GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) to model volatility and risk.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
   - Compare the forecasted results with the actual data to assess prediction accuracy.

5. **Results Communication**  
   - Summarize and communicate the findings using clear visualizations and reports.
   - Present the results to stakeholders using appropriate formats (PDF, PowerPoint, etc.).

## Key Concepts

### ARIMA Model
- **AR (AutoRegressive)**: Models the relationship between an observation and lagged observations.
- **I (Integrated)**: Makes the series stationary by differencing.
- **MA (Moving Average)**: Models the relationship between an observation and residual errors from lagged observations.
- **Purpose**: ARIMA helps forecast future values in a time series by capturing trends and patterns.

### GARCH Model
- **Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity**: A statistical model used to estimate the volatility of financial time series data.
- **Purpose**: GARCH models volatility clustering, where periods of high volatility are followed by more high volatility and vice versa.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - statsmodels
  - matplotlib
  - arch (for GARCH model)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
